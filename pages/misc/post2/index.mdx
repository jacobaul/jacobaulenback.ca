## Posts are written in Markdown 

Each post is writted in clean, easy to read markdown files. All the usual formatting (and more) is allowed. Each markdown style will be compiled automatically into a pretty web page at build time.
 
**TEXT CAN BE BOLD** *OR ITALIC*

> OR CAN APPEAR IN
> A QUOTE BLOCK

### Sub headings are simple

1. Ordered lists are easy too
2. Easier than writing it in Word even
3. All the hard work is done behind the scenes.

Inserting images is clean and easy as well.

Markdown allows you to write articles in an expressive way without worrying about formatting details. All the formatting can be tweaked globally with CSS for changing design styles.
